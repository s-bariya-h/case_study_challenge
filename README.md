> * The work environment is based on Volume-Bind workflow using Docker meaning that all the data on local machine is persistent with the data inside the Docker Container
> * The `cypress/config/config.js` file contains all the configurations for a better code architecture
> * All the tests are contained inside the `cypress/integration/specs.js` file

## Problem Statement


#### Search for “Texas” using the search functionality<br>
  1. Verify that the displayed number of search results is correct

<br/>

<img align="left" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65415371/124740340-9eb50180-df12-11eb-9295-e33ac2752c57.png" width="50px" />

## Solution

<br>

### 📋 Test Case:
#### CaseID_1

``` {.sourceCode .gherkin}
Feature: Search functionality of trivago Magazine
    In order to verify that the displayed number of search results is correct

Scenario: Search for a specific city
    Given I am a trivago Magazine user using URL https://magazine.trivago.com/
      And I click on search icon
      And The search menu is visible
     When I enter 'Texas' in the search field
      And I hit enter
     Then I should see search menu populating with search results
      And Search result count on top should be equal to the number of displayed results on the page

```

## Problem Statement


#### From the displayed results open “Mom Knows Best: Family Vacations in Texas”<br>
  1. Verify that the list of “Featured hotels and resorts” displays all hotels featured in the article
  2. Verify that there are no broken links in the article

<br>

## Solution

<br>

### 📋 Test Cases:


``` {.sourceCode .gherkin}
Feature: Article Content
```
#### CaseID_2.1
``` {.sourceCode .gherkin}
Scenario: Verify that the list of 'Featured hotels and resorts' displays all hotels featured in the article
    Given I am a trivago Magazine user using URL https://magazine.trivago.com/
      And I click on search icon
      And The search menu is visible
     When I enter 'Texas' in the search field
      And I hit enter
     Then I should see search menu populating with search results
     When I click to select 'Mom Knows Best: Family Vacations in Texas'
     Then I should be redirected to the 'Mom Knows Best: 10 Family Vacations in Texas 
        to Inspire Your Next Trip' article page
     And 'Featured hotels and resorts' title should be displayed on the right side of the article
     And: All hotels title which are in the article should be listed under 'Featured hotels and resorts'
```
> #### 💡 Observation in Task 2.1
> * The above task could not be completed because of code inconsistency. 
> * There were multiple elements with the same class name but inconsistent content and hence a loop traversal could not be executed for checking the featured hotels. 
> * This cannot be worked around by accessing each element specifically but that is against the best practices as well as not very scalable.
> * Below image may help achieve clarity of the problem.

#### CaseID_2.2

``` {.sourceCode .gherkin}
Scenario: Verify that there are no broken links in the article
    Given I am a trivago Magazine user using URL https://magazine.trivago.com/
      And I click on search icon
      And The search menu is visible
     When I enter 'Texas' in the search field
      And I hit enter
     Then I should see search menu populating with search results
     When I click to select 'Mom Knows Best: Family Vacations in Texas'
     Then I should be redirected to the 'Mom Knows Best: 10 Family Vacations in Texas 
        to Inspire Your Next Trip' article page
      And None of the links should have an href as "#undefined" 
```

#### Steps:

- Clone the repository
- Once inside the directory, Run `docker-compose up` in the terminal.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

- You will see the test cases running.
- After the first run, you will see `cypress/videos` and `cypress/screenshots` folders appear in your local machine. Check out there content for yourself!
- If you want to see/edit the content of the test file, go to `~/cypress/integration/spec.js`
- `spec.js` file follows the generic content in the `~/cypress/config/config.js` file.
- If you edit the tests and run again, change the content of the `spec.js` file and run `docker-compose up` again from the terminal.
